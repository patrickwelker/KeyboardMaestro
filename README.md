KeyboardMaestro
===============

A collection of Keyboard Maestro macros. You can click on the headings to get to the corresponding articles on [RocketINK](http://rocketink.net).

## [Bookmarklets](http://rocketink.net/2013/01/Keyboard-Maestro-and-your-browser.html)

I doubt they are interesting for anyone, but maybe it's shorter for you to copy and paste in your own bookmarklets than starting from scratch.

The point of have palettes for bookmarklets is to:

- use less extensions and save ressources 
- have custom shortcuts to all bookmarklets

## [nvALT](http://rocketink.net/2013/01/my-nvalt-setup.html)

This folder contains my remapped shortcuts and an editor palette to open nvALT notes in the text editor of you choice.

As a little extra there's also the Byword theme (drop it in ) for the Markdown preview in nvALT and my color scheme which can be imported into Apple's color picker.

## [OmniFocus Macros](http://rocketink.net/2013/01/keyboard-maestro-as-omnifocus%27s-little-helper.html)

### Perspectives Palette

![omnifocus-perspectives-preview](http://cl.ly/LwAM/omnifocus-perspectives-preview.jpg)

A palette that can be triggered via a global hotkey and displays your favorite OmniFocus perspectives.

If OmniFocus isn't running it will be openend with the selected perspective.

Customize the macro by using the names of your own OmniFocus perspectives and hotkeys that work for you.

### Scripts Palette

This is a collection of all the scripts I use with Keyboard Maestro and OmniFocus. The people who made these scripts are collected in a reference list in [this blog post](http://rocketink.net/2013/01/keyboard-maestro-as-omnifocus%27s-little-helper.html).

## [Finder And Path Finder](http://rocketink.net/uploads/2013/02/bridging-the-gap-between-finder-and-path-finder.html)

This is my setup for transfering some of Path Finder functions into Finder. In addition there are some Path Finder only goodies.

## [Screen Shots](http://rocketink.net/2013/02/screenshots-and-image-manipulation.html)

A palette for making different sort of screen shots. [The article](http://rocketink.net/2013/02/screenshots-and-image-manipulation.html) explains everthing in detail.
